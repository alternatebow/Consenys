# Decentralized Sports Gambling

#### (Consensys Bootcamp Capstone Project)

***

I am a huge sports junkie and I wanted to find a way to merge my love for sports with my curiosity with blockchain technology. With sports gambling becoming more and more mainstream these days, I decided to consider a project such as this.
 
The focus of my project is to develop an decentralized application that uses smart contracts to work out conditions and agreements of wagers regarding the outcome of sporting events. The point of this application is to act as an arbiter, bookmaker and escrow for multiple betting parties and thus ensures a fair and impartial sports gambling procedure.

General Example of the workflow: (To be updated as I flesh this idea more)

1. Users register themselves as participants within the application.
2. Based on an upcoming sporting event a smart contract will be written up corresponding to it.
3. For simplicity the odds can be taken from major sports betting websites: mybookie, Fanduel, etc.
4. Users interact with a front-end client and select the wagers they choose to make.
5. Prior to the start of the event, all funds are locked into the smart contract until the conclusion of the sporting event.
6. At the conclusion of the event, payouts are determined by the smart contract and Users recieve their earnings if the conditions for their bets were fulfilled.
7. Bets whose conditions were unfufilled will only have any gas fees refunded.
