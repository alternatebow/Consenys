### Problem
When it comes to gambling, the common adage "The house always wins" is not simply a phrase to warn against playing at a casino in the long run, it is a system where mathematically speaking, casinos and bookeepers are virtually guaranteed to make a profit regardless of the results or bets placed. This is  because casinos (both in-person and online) have what is called, 'House advantage'. What this means is that over the long run,  casinos are not paying out winning  bets according to their 'true odds'. For example, on any roll of the die, their is an equal probability (1/6) that the face 1 through 6 will appear and accordingly the 'true payout' should be 6 times the original bet. However, this does not happen as the casino would not earn much profit if it were to pay out the true odds, so instead they pay a percentage of it; this portion of the true payout that they keep is known as the 'House edge'. 

With blockchain technology, gambling dapps utilizing smart contracts can elminate the involvement of the casino taking a portion of the payout, as well as ensure provably fair games, instant payouts and anonimity. Due to the decentralized nature of interactions on a dApp, all transactions would not involve a central provider who controls the game and handles the money, instead it would strictly be between the game and the players with the wagers handled by smart contracts acting as an escrow.
